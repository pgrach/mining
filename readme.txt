Cryptocurrency Mining Performance Dashboard

Objective: 
Create a comprehensive dashboard that provides real-time insights into a user's cryptocurrency mining operations using the f2pool's APIs.

Data Sources:
Use the f2pool API to fetch data regarding mining performance.
External APIs: difficulty level
Datasets: 
 such as cryptocurrency market prices, for a holistic view.
Data Pipeline:

Extract: Use the provided API endpoints to fetch data about the user's mining performance, transaction history, and wallet balances.
Transform: Clean and aggregate the data. Calculate key metrics such as total revenue, average hashrate, stale rate, and more. Merge data from different sources to give a holistic view.
Load: Store the transformed data in an SQL database or cloud storage for easy retrieval.
End Outcome:

Dashboard: Create a visually appealing dashboard that displays key metrics such as:
Current balance and total payments.
Mining performance metrics (current hashrate, average hashrate, rejected hashrate, etc.).
Transaction history with filtering options.
Distribution details for hashrate and revenue.
Pool information like recent blocks mined.
Allow users to drill down into specific metrics for a detailed view. For instance, clicking on a specific cryptocurrency could show its detailed mining performance.
Additional Steps:

Scheduling: Use Apache Airflow or cron jobs to regularly run the data pipeline, ensuring that the dashboard displays up-to-date information.
Documentation: Create a detailed README file that explains the purpose of the project, the data sources used, the transformations applied, and how to use the dashboard. Include screenshots and sample queries.
Version Control: Maintain a GitHub repository for the project, ensuring that code changes are committed regularly with meaningful commit messages.
Stretch Goals:

Predictive Analytics: Use the historical mining performance data to predict future earnings or hashrate performance.
Alerts: Implement a system that notifies the user when certain metrics (like hashrate dropping below a threshold) are triggered.
Integration with Other Platforms: Consider integrating with other mining platforms or financial tools to provide a unified view of the user's cryptocurrency operations.
